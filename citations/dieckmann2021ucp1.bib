	abstract = {Objective Activation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) upon cold stimulation leads to substantial increase in energy expenditure to defend body temperature. Increases in energy expenditure after a high caloric food intake, termed diet-induced thermogenesis, are also attributed to BAT. These properties render BAT a potential target to combat diet-induced obesity. However, studies investigating the role of UCP1 to protect against diet-induced obesity are controversial and rely on the phenotyping of a single constitutive UCP1-knockout model.To address this issue, we generated a novel UCP1-knockout model by Cre-mediated deletion of Exon 2 in the UCP1 gene. We studied the effect of constitutive UCP1 knockout on metabolism and the development of diet-induced obesity.Methods UCP1 knockout and wildtype mice were housed at 30{\textdegree}C and fed a control diet for 4-weeks followed by 8-weeks of high-fat diet. Body weight and food intake were monitored continuously over the course of the study and indirect calorimetry was used to determine energy expenditure during both feeding periods.Results Based on Western blot analysis, thermal imaging and noradrenaline test, we confirmed the lack of functional UCP1 in knockout mice. However, body weight gain, food intake and energy expenditure were not affected by deletion of UCP1 gene function during both feeding periods.Conclusion Conclusively, we show that UCP1 does not protect against diet-induced obesity at thermoneutrality. Further we introduce a novel UCP1-KO mouse enabling the generation of conditional UCP1-knockout mice to scrutinize the contribution of UCP1 to energy metabolism in different cell types or life stages.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
