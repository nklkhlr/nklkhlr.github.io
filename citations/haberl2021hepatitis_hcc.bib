	ABSTRACT = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still remains a difficult to cure malignancy. In recent years, the focus has shifted to lipid metabolism for the treatment of HCC. Very little is known about hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus (HCV)-related hepatic lipid disturbances in non-malignant and cancer tissues. The present study showed that triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations were similar in tumor adjacent HBV and HCV liver, and were not induced in the HCC tissues. Higher levels of free cholesterol, polyunsaturated phospholipids and diacylglycerol species were noted in non-tumorous HBV compared to HCV liver. Moreover, polyunsaturated phospholipids and diacylglycerols, and ceramides declined in tumors of HBV infected patients. All of these lipids remained unchanged in HCV-related HCC. In HCV tumors, polyunsaturated phosphatidylinositol levels were even induced. There were no associations of these lipid classes in non-tumor tissues with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis scores. Moreover, these lipids did not correlate with tumor grade or T-stage in HCC tissues. Lipid reprogramming of the three analysed HBV/HCV related tumors mostly resembled HBV-HCC. Indeed, lipid composition of non-tumorous HCV tissue, HCV tumors, HBV tumors and HBV/HCV tumors was highly similar. The tumor suppressor protein p53 regulates lipid metabolism. The p53 and p53S392 protein levels were induced in the tumors of HBV, HCV and double infected patients, and this was significant in HBV infection. Negative correlation of tumor p53 protein with free cholesterol indicates a role of p53 in cholesterol metabolism. In summary, the current study suggests that therapeutic strategies to target lipid metabolism in chronic viral hepatitis and associated cancers have to consider disease etiology.},
