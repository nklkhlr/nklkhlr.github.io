* 04/2024:
    * Excited to start a new position as a postdoc in the [group of Britta Velten](https://velten-group.org) to work on ML methods for spatial omics data
* 08/2023:
	* I will be at the [8{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{th}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} Lipidomics Forum](https://ilsconf.org). Joins us for a workshop on Lipidomics Data Analysis and my poster on Network-Guided Lipidomics Data Analysis
* 05/2023:
	* The latest main publication from my PhD work is out on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.15.540613v1.abstract). We present a novel approach to infer changes in metabolic reaction activity from metabolomics data using metabolic networks.
* 01/2023
	* Our [work on Lipid Network Analysis](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/1/bbac572/6966533) is finally published in Briefings in Bioinformatics
	* A [review on computational epilipidomics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04406) I contributed to is now available in Analytical Chemistry
* 10/2022
 	* I'll be at [ICSB 2022](https://www.icsb2022.berlin/) presenting our lipid metabolic network enrichment method
* 06/2022:
	* We published an update version of the LINEX{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{2}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} manuscript on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.04.479101v2.abstract)
* 04/2022:
	* Our ensemble biclustering approach is out in PNAS. Go check it out [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2118210119)
* 03/2022:
	* I will give a keynote presenting our work on inferring differential reaction activity from lipidomics data at the [10{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{th}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} Workshop in Lipidomics](http://www.cesam.ua.pt/files/FOODLIPIDOMICS2.pdf)
* 02/2022:
	* New Preprint Alert: my second first author manuscript is out on [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.04.479101). We introduce a novel way of performing lipid metabolic network analysis (in the LINEX framework) and demonstrate how it can infer enzymatic activity changes using only lipidomics data.
* 12/2021:
	* I will present the updates for LINEX coming soon in session 6 at the  [Virtual Podium Asia Pacific](https://virtualpodiumasiap.wixsite.com/vpap2021)
		* __Update__: happy I won the best short talk award for my session!
* 11/2021:
	* Join me for the [Metabolism Meets Epigenetics](https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/ees21-12/) Tools and System Analyses Poster Session to learn more about our recent project investigation metabolic network-based multi-omics integration
* 10/2021:
	* Happy to have our work on ensemble biclustering out as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.30.462567v1)
* 09/2021: I will be presenting our work on lipid network analysis at the [1{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{st}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} ILS conference/7{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{th}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} Lipidomics Forum](https://ils2021.org/workshops)
	* All materials from the conference workshop and talk will be available [here](https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/ils2021)
* 07/2021:
	* My first first author paper is published: __[Investigating Global Lipidome Alterations with the Lipid Network Explorer](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/11/8/488)__.
	* We are giving a LipiTUM workshop at the [1{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{st}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} ILS conference/7{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{th}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} Lipidomics Forum](https://ils2021.org/workshops). Join us if you want to learn about network methods for lipidomics data analysis and patient stratification.
