* 02/2022:
	* New Preprint Alert: my second first author manuscript is out on [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.04.479101). We introduce a novel way of performing lipid metabolic network analysis and demonstrate how it can infer enzymatic activity changes using only lipidomics data.
* 12/2021:
	* I will present the updates for LINEX coming soon in session 6 at the  [Virtual Podium Asia Pacific](https://virtualpodiumasiap.wixsite.com/vpap2021)
		* __Update__: happy I won the best short talk award for my session!
* 11/2021:
	* Join me for the [Metabolism Meets Epigenetics](https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/ees21-12/) Tools and System Analyses Poster Session to learn more about our recent project investigation metabolic network-based multi-omics integration
* 10/2021:
	* Happy to have our work on ensemble biclustering out as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.30.462567v1)
* 09/2021: I will be presenting our work on lipid network analysis at the [1{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{st}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} ILS conference/7{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{th}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} Lipidomics Forum](https://ils2021.org/workshops)
	* All materials from the conference workshop and talk will be available [here](https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/ils2021)
* 07/2021:
	* My first first author paper is published: __[Investigating Global Lipidome Alterations with the Lipid Network Explorer](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/11/8/488)__.
	* We are giving a LipiTUM workshop at the [1{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{st}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} ILS conference/7{{<mathjax/inline>}}\(^{th}\){{</mathjax/inline>}} Lipidomics Forum](https://ils2021.org/workshops). Join us if you want to learn about network methods for lipidomics data analysis and patient stratification.
