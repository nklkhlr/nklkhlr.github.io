I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Velten lab](https://velten-group.org) working on machine learning methods to analyze spatial omics data.
Prior to my current role, I was a PhD Student in Bioinformatics in the [LipiTUM group](https://www.lipitum.de) at the [Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics](https://www1.ls.tum.de/en/exbio/home/) at the Technical University of Munich.
The main focus of my research currently lies on computational methods for the interpretation and (multi-omics) integration of metabolomics data in a systems biology context.
For developing these algorithms I am utilising methods from (classical) graph-theory, machine learning and deep-learning.
I am also interested in applying computational models to real-world data. At the moment this means mostly biomedical data. However, I have spend quite some time on applications in plant science in the past, as well.

<!-- TODO: add a note on what I also enjoy (TDA, etc.) -->
