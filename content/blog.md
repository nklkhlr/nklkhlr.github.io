In Progress...

I'm planning to write (somewhat regularly) about

* mid- to high-level introductions to metabolomics data-analysis for experimentalists
* mid- to high-level introductions to mass-spectrometry for metabolomics for bioinformaticians
* novel methods I find interesting
* maybe occassionally off-topic stuff like communication, experiences as a PhD student etc.
