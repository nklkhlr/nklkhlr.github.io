In Progress...

I'm planning to write (somewhat regularly) about

* introduction to metabolomics data-analysis for experimentalists
* introduction to mass-spectrometry for metabolomics for bioinformaticians
* machine learning applications in computational biology
* any other novel methods I find interesting
* occassionally off-topic stuff like communication, experiences as a PhD student etc.
