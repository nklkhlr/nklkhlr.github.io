	abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses contribute to cancer development, with activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) involved in microbiota-dependent tumorigenesis. Here we show the clinical relevance of ATF6 in individuals with early-onset and late colorectal cancer, and link ATF6 signalling to changes in lipid metabolism and intestinal microbiota. Transcriptional analysis in intestinal epithelial cells of ATF6 transgenic mice (nATF6IEC) identifies bacteria-specific changes in cellular metabolism enriched for fatty acid biosynthesis. Untargeted metabolomics and isotype labelling confirm ATF6-related enrichment of long-chain fatty acids in colonic tissue of humans, mice and organoids. FASN inhibition and microbiota transfer in germ-free nATF6IEC mice confirm the causal involvement of ATF6-induced lipid alterations in tumorigenesis. The selective expansion of tumour-relevant microbial taxa, including Desulfovibrio fairfieldensis, is mechanistically linked to long-chain fatty acid exposure using bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging, and growth analysis of Desulfovibrio isolates. We postulate chronic ATF6 signalling to select for tumour-promoting microbiota by altering lipid metabolism.},
